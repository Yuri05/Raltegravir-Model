<p>The general concept of building a PBPK model has previously been described by Kuepfer et al. (<a href="./References.md">KueSDpfer 2016</a>) Regarding the relevant anthropometric (height, weight) and physiological parameters (e.g. blood flows, organ volumes, binding protein concentrations, hematocrit, cardiac output) in adults was gathered from the literature and has been previously published (<a href="./References.md">PK-Sim Ontogeny Database Version 7.3</a>). The information was incorporated into PK-Sim® and was used as default values for the simulations in adults.</p>
<p>The  applied activity and variability of plasma proteins and active processes that are integrated into PK-Sim® are described in the publicly available ‘PK-Sim® Ontogeny Database Version 7.3' (<a href="./References.md">Schlender 2016</a>) or otherwise referenced for the specific process.</p>
<p>First, a base mean model was built using data from the single dose escalation study study to find an appropriate structure describing the PK of Raltegravir plasma. The mean PK model was developed using a typical European individual. Unknown parameters were identified using the Parameter Identification module provided in PK-Sim®. Structural model selection was mainly guided by visual inspection of the resulting description of data and biological plausibility.</p>
<p>Once the appropriate structural model was identified, additional parameters for different formulations were identified. </p>
<p>A final PBPK model was established and simulations were compared to the reported data to evaluate model appropriateness and to assess model qualification, by means of diagnostics plots and predicted versus observed concentration-time profiles, of which the results support an adequate prediction of the PK in adults.</p>
<p>During model building, uncertainties in data-quality, as well as study differences may cause not being able to adequately describe the PK of all reported clinical study data. </p>
